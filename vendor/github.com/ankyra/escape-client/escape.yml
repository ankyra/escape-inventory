# Examples:
#
# Reference the full release ID to pin to a particular version:

#
# To always get the latest version of a particular release:
#   depends: [archive-example-latest]
#
# Or:
#   depends: [archive-example-@]
#
# To resolve the latest minor release:
#   depends: [archive-example-v0.@]
#
# To resolve the latest path release:
#   depends: [archive-example-v0.1.@]

# Errands are scripts that can be run against the deployment of this release.
# The scripts receive the deployment's inputs and outputs as environment
# variables.

#   errands:
#     my-errand:
#       description: "Run this errand to do something special"
#       script: bin/my_errand.sh
#       inputs:
