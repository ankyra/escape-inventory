# Build the next minor release in the 1.* series:

# Dependencies. Reference dependencies by their full release ID or use
# the '@' symbol to resolve versions at build time.
#
# Examples:
#
# Reference the full release ID to pin to a particular version:
#   depends: [archive-example-v0.1]
#
# To always get the latest version of a particular release:
#   depends: [archive-example-latest]
#
# Or:
#   depends: [archive-example-@]
#
# To resolve the latest minor release:
#   depends: [archive-example-v0.@]
#
# To resolve the latest path release:
#   depends: [archive-example-v0.1.@]

# Escape script can be used as values, but note that the metadata is compiled

# Errands.
#
# Errands are scripts that can be run against the deployment of this release.
# The scripts receive the deployment's inputs and outputs as environment
# variables.

# Examples:
#
#   errands:
#     my-errand:
#       description: "Run this errand to do something special"
#       script: bin/my_errand.sh
#       inputs:
#       - extra_input
#
# For information on the syntax of the input variables see the "inputs" field.
